# HermesPy
HermesPy (Heterogeneous Radio Mobile Simulator - Python) is a semi-static link-level simulator based on time-driven mechanisms.

It provides a framework for the link-level simulation of a multi-RAT wireless link, consisting of
multiple transmit and receive modems, which may operate at different carrier frequencies. Besides
simulating individual transmission links, HermesPy allows the analysis of both co-channel and
adjacent-channel interference among different communication systems.
