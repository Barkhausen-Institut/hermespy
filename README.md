# HermesPy
HermesPy (Heterogeneous Radio Mobile Simulator - Python) is a semi-static link-level simulator based on time-driven mechanisms.

It provides a framework for the link-level simulation of a multi-RAT wireless link, consisting of
multiple transmit and receive modems, which may operate at different carrier frequencies. 
In addition to simulating individual transmission links, HermesPy allows the analysis of both co-channel and
adjacent-channel interference among different communication systems.
