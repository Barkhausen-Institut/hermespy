# HermesPy

HermesPy (Heterogeneous Radio Mobile Simulator - Python) is a semi-static link-level simulator based on time-driven mechanisms.

It provides a framework for the link-level simulation of a multi-RAT wireless link, consisting of
multiple transmit and receive modems, which may operate at different carrier frequencies. Besides
simulating individual transmission links, HermesPy allows the analysis of both co-channel and
adjacent-channel interference among different communication systems.

# Features

The curent release "Platform Release" serves as a platform for joint development. Beside some core functionality, that can be found beside the [release plan](FEATURES.md), its main focus is to provide a software architecture that can be easily extended.

# Installation

- `git clone <this-repo>`
- Change to `hermespy/`

**Windows users:**
- `conda create -n <envname> python=3.7` (can be omitted for ubuntu users)
- `conda activate <envname>` (can be omitted for ubuntu users)
- `conda install pip` (can be omitted for ubuntu users)
- `pip install -r requirements.txt`

**Ubuntu users**:
- Ensure `python` is linked to python3.7
- `python -m venv env`
- `. env/bin/activate`
- `pip install -r requirements.txt`
 

[Quadriga channel model v2.1.30](https://quadriga-channel-model.de/) is supported by HermesPy.
For it to be used, some preliminary steps need to be taken for it to be used. It can be run with either Octave or matlab. For **octave**, under Windows, you need to set the environemnt variable that tells python where to find octave-cli executable by calling

```
setx PATH "%PATH%;<path-to-octave-cli>
```

and install `oct2py` via `pip install oct2py` (Ubuntu sets the environment variable automatically).

If you want to run **matlab**, you must use the `matlab.engine` package proided by Matlab. Refer to [this](https://de.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_external/install-the-matlab-engine-for-python.html) link.

# Running the simulator

1. Activate your virtual environment:
   1. **Windows**: `conda activate <envname>`
   2. **ubuntu**: `. env/bin/activate` 
2. The simulator can be called by `python hermes.py <param> <output_dir>`.

The main execution file is `hermes.py -p <settings-directory -o <results-directory>`. Both command line parameters are optional arguments. `<settings-directory>` contains settings files for the simulation and `<results-directory>` tells the simulator where to put the result files. Both are relative paths and have default values namely `_settings` and `results`. All parameters values in the settings files are in SI units. Plase refer to our documentation (see below).

Some examples may be found in the **_examples** folder. Check the readmes.

## Quadriga

Set `Multipath=QUADRIGA` for **all channels** in `settings_scenario.ini`. The Quadriga channel model will then use a combination of the values provided in all `settings_*.ini` files. Quadriga-specific values are located in the `settings_quadriga.ini`. **Check before first use.**

**Important note:** As SNR-Values, use `SNR=CUSTOM`. Setting this value to custom, values provided for `snr_vector` are interpreted as actual noise variance (in dB/Hz). Check test files for actual values.

**Important note**: If you decide to run with matlab/octave, ensure you installed matlab/octave and octpy/matlab.engine. Otherwise the program will crash. Although some catches are implemented, this can lead to errors.

## Running the tests

Tests may be run by calling `pytest` in the root directory. They test for

- type linting using [mypy](mypy.readthedocs.io/)
- basic checks on pep8
- unit tests.

If only unit tests are to be executed, call `python run_unit_tests.py`.

**Attention:** Due to current GIT LFS storage issues, integrity tests will be uploaded in the future.

# Documentation

Documentation can be found [here](https://barkhausen-institut.github.io/hermespy/index.html). It is auto-generated by the github action.
Quadriga documentation can be found in **hermes/docs**.

# Known Limitations

- no parallelization of the simulation
- LDPC code performance insufficient
- general performance improvemenets required
- the CI is currently not executing the unit tests due to LFS restrictions. This will be fixed in the coming weeks.
