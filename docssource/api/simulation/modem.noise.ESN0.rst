The symbol energy to noise power spectral density ratio (ES/N0) is a measure of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in a communication system.
It is defined as the ratio of the energy per symbol to the noise power spectral density. The ES/N0 is a key parameter in the design of digital communication systems, and is used to determine the required signal-to-noise ratio for a given bit error rate.
