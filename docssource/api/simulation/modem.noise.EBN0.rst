The bit energy to noise power spectral density ratio (Eb/N0) is a fundamental parameter in digital communication systems.
It is defined as the ratio of the energy per bit to the noise power spectral density.
The Eb/N0 is a key parameter in the design of digital communication systems, and is used to determine the minimum signal-to-noise ratio required to achieve a certain bit error rate.
