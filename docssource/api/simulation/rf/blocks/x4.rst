Frequency Multipliers
=====================

Radio-Frequency (RF) frequency multipliers are non-linear components that generate output signals at integer multiples of the input signal frequency.
They are commonly used in communication and radar systems to achieve higher frequencies from lower-frequency sources.
In the process, they may introduce harmonic distortion, phase noise, and conversion loss.

This module provides various numerical models of RF frequency multipliers.
