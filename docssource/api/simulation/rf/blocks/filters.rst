Filters
=======

Radio-Frequency (RF) filters selectively pass spectral signal components of desired frequency ranges while attenuating undesired frequencies.
They are commonly used to remove out-of-band noise, suppress interference, and shape signal spectra in communication and radar systems.

This module provides various numerical models of filters commonly applied in front-ends.
