Frequency Sources
=================

Radio-Frequency (RF) sources generate signals at specific frequencies and power levels for use in communication, radar, and measurement systems.
They are characterized by parameters such as frequency stability, phase noise and output power.

This module provides various numerical models of RF sources.
