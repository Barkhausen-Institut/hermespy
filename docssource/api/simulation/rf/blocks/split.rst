Splitters
=========

Radio-Frequency (RF) splitters divide an input signal into multiple output signals, typically with equal amplitude and phase characteristics.
They are commonly used in communication systems to distribute signals to multiple paths.
In the process, they may introduce insertion loss, phase imbalance, and crosstalk between output ports.

This module provides various numerical models of RF splitters.
