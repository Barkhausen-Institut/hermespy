Mixers

Radio-Frequency (RF) mixers are components combining two input signals by multipling them,
resulting in sum and difference frequency components at the output.
In the process, they commonly introduce non-linear distortion, phase shifts, thermal noise and
leakage of the local oscillator signal to the output.

This module provides various numerical models of RF mixers.
