Hardware Loop
=============

The hardware loop modules provides all required functionalities to transmit waveforms generated by
HermesPy over real hardware setups such as USRPs (Universal Software-Defined Radio Peripherals).

   hardware_loop.hardware_loop
   hardware_loop.physical_device
   hardware_loop.scenario
   hardware_loop.physical_device_dummy
   hardware_loop.visualizers

as well as specific bindings to UHD devices
