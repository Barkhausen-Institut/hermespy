    abstract={The probability of error in decoding an optimal convolutional code transmitted over a memoryless channel is bounded from above and below as a function of the constraint length of the code. For all but pathological channels the bounds are asymptotically (exponentially) tight for rates above<tex>R_{0}</tex>, the computational cutoff rate of sequential decoding. As a function of constraint length the performance of optimal convolutional codes is shown to be superior to that of block codes of the same length, the relative improvement increasing with rate. The upper bound is obtained for a specific probabilistic nonsequential decoding algorithm which is shown to be asymptotically optimum for rates above<tex>R_{0}</tex>and whose performance bears certain similarities to that of sequential decoding algorithms.},

    abstract={Simple two-parameter formulas are presented for the functions involved in the amplitude-phase and the quadrature nonlinear models of a TWT amplifier, and are shown to fit measured data very well. Also, a closed-form expression is derived for the output signal of a TWT amplifier excited by two phase-modulated carriers, and an expression containing a single integral is given when more than two such earriers are involved. Finally, a frequencydependent quadrature model is proposed whose parameters are obtainable from single-tone measurements.},

        abstract = {Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) in conjunction with a 4-DPSK modulation format has been proposed for the future digital audio broadcasting system (DAB), that should provide compact disk sound quality in portable, vehicular and fixed receivers.  With properly chosen parameters, this system should be appropriate for both terrestrial and satellite transmission.  In this paper the influence of the nonlinear distortions introduced by the high power amplifier (HPA) of the transmitter is examined.  In particular, the degradation in power efficiency due to intermodulation effects and backoff operating, as well as spectral degradations are investigated.It is shown for three different kinds of limiting amplifier models, that even with an output backoff (OBO) in the region of 5-6 dB, the degradation of, e.g., a 512-carrier 4-DPSK/OFDM system relative to the linear case is below 1.7 dB, while the regenerated sidelobes of the transmitted spectrum are kept below -20 dB.},

    abstract = {Timing and carrier synchronization is a fundamental requirement for any wireless communication system to work properly. Timing synchronization is the process by which a receiver node determines the correct instants of time at which to sample the incoming signal. Carrier synchronization is the process by which a receiver adapts the frequency and phase of its local carrier oscillator with those of the received signal. In this paper, we survey the literature over the last 5 years (2010--2014) and present a comprehensive literature review and classification of the recent research progress in achieving timing and carrier synchronization in single-input single-output (SISO), multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO), cooperative relaying, and multiuser/multicell interference networks. Considering both single-carrier and multi-carrier communication systems, we survey and categorize the timing and carrier synchronization techniques proposed for the different communication systems focusing on the system model assumptions for synchronization, the synchronization challenges, and the state-of-the-art synchronization solutions and their limitations. Finally, we envision some future research directions.},
