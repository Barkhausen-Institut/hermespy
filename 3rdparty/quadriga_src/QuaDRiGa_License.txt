1. INTRODUCTION

The Quadriga Channel Model ("QuaDRiGa") is used for generating realistic radio channel impulse 
responses for system-level simulations of mobile radio networks. These simulations are used to 
determine the performance of new technologies in order to provide an objective indicator for the 
standardization process in bodies like the third generation partnership program 3GPP.

Quadriga was developed at Fraunhofer HHI to enable the modeling of MIMO radio channels for specific 
network configurations, such as indoor, satellite or heterogeneous configurations. Besides being a 
fully-fledged three dimensional geometry-based stochastic channel model, QuaDRiGa contains a 
collection of features created in SCM(e) and WINNER channel models along with novel modeling 
approaches which provide features to enable quasi-deterministic multi-link tracking of users 
(receiver) movements in changing environments.
