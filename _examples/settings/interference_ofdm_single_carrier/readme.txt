In this example we simulate the interference between an OFDM signal and a
single-carrier signal in an AWGN channel.

The OFDM signal has the same numerology as an LTE system with 20 MHz bandwidth,
in which the first 8 sub-frames are used.
However, the bits are uncoded. The carrier frequency is 3.5 GHz.

A single carrier 64-QAM interferer with 6 Mbps is also transmitting at 3.501 GHz
