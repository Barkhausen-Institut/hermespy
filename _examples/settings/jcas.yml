# This simulation evaluates a joint communication and sensing scenario.
#
# We assume a base station communicating with a terminal using a single-carrier
# waveform. Simulataneously, the base-station infers spatial information from
# its backscattered communication signal.
#
# The simulation evaluates both the bit error rate of the downling commuication
# between base station and terminal as well as the probability of detection of an
# object within the base-stations vicinity.s
