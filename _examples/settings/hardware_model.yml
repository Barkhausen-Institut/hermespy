# In this example we simulate the effects of a non-ideal
# Radio-Frequency chain and analog-to-digital conversion on the bit error rate performance
# of a single-carrier communication system.
# We consider I/Q imbalance, a power amplifier following Rapp's model and an adc with
# mid-riser quantization and automatic gain control.
# 
# The performance is evaluated for a signal-to-noise ratio between zero and 20 dB.
