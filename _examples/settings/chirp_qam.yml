# In this example we simulate a frame of QAM modulated overlapping chirps.
# 
# A bandwidth of 100 MHz is considered with chirps separated at the Nyquist
# sampling rate. Modulation is 16-QAM, yielding an uncoded bit rate of 400 Mbps.
# Chirps have a duration of 1 \mu s.
# The interchirp interference is compensated by an MMSE block equalizer.
# 
# A non-linear amplifier following Rapp's model is also considered.
# 
# Each frame transmits 10 unmodulated non-overlapping chirps at the beginning,
# followed by 1000 modulated chirps.
# 
# Channel is AWGN.
