In this example we simulate a 5G signal.

We model the DL of a frame with a TDD slot format 57, DDDDFFUDDDDFFU,
with 30kHz subcarrier spacing, using 2400 subcarriers with 4-PSK.

In each drop, 2 time slots are transmitted.

An LDPC code with rate R=1/2 and block length 256 is considered.

MIMO (SM) with 2x2 antennas is considered.

A 5G-TDL channel model type E, with 100 ns rms delay spread is considered.
Velocity is 10ms with carrier frequency 3GHz.
