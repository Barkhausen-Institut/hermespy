# In this example we simulate FSK modulated chirps (similar to LORA).
# A bandwidth of B = 500kHz is considered, with spreading factor SF = 8,
# This corresponds to M = 2^SF = 256 different initial frequencies, spaced by
# \delta_f = B / M = 1953.125Hz
# The symbol rate (chirp duration) is given by Ts = 2^SF/BW = .512 ms
# Data is uncoded, and the data rate is
# SF * BW / 2 **SF = log2(M) / Ts = 15625 kbps
# 
# Frames have 160 bits, i.e., 20 FSK symbols.
# 
# A carrier frequency of 865MHz is considered, with Rayleigh fading and a speed
# of 10m/s
