# This file specifies the simulator scenario, i.e., the transmitter, receivers and channel models between them.
# The simulation may consist of several transmit and receive modems.
# All transmitters must be specified in sections 'TxModem_i', with i the transmit modem index, starting with i=1.
# All receivers must be specified in sections 'RxModem_j', with i the receive modem index, starting with j=1.
# Between every pair of receiver and transmitter modem, a channel model must be specified, in 'Channel_i_to_j'.

# supported_values:
#   "NONE", "STOCHASTIC", "COST259", "EXPONENTIAL", "QUADRIGA"
#   "STOCHASTIC": a stochastic channel model follows an arbitrary power delay profile, defined in the parameters
#   "COST-259": measurement-based power delay profile defined in COST 259, according to a given scenario
#   "EXPONENTIAL": stochastic model with an exponential-decay power delay profile
#   "QUADRIGA": QuaDRiGa channel model
# parameter is optional (default = NONE)

# channel can be attenuated to simulate different interference scenarios
# attenuation is given in dB (please note that this will affect the SNR)
# a +3dB attenuation means that the signal will have half of its power
# optional (default = 0)

# parameters of a STOCHASTIC Rice/Rayleigh-faded multipath channel
# the power delay profile is given in terms of path delays, relative power (in dB), K-factor of the Rice distribution
# (in dB) and the Doppler frequency . For Rayleigh fading, choose K-factor equal to "-inf", for LOS, K-Factor is "inf".
# The parameters corresponding to power delay profile (delays, power_delay_profile_db, k_rice_db) must be vectors of the
# same size.
# The power delay profile will be normalized, only relative values are important.
# velocity (in m/s) is a scalar.
# These parameters are optional, and are needed only for an stochastic channel model
#
# example, for single-path Rayleigh fading (default)
#   delays = 0
#   power_delay_profile_db = 0
#   k_rice_db = -inf
# example, for a 3-path model with Ricean fading at first path

#   k_rice_db = 3, -inf, -inf

# parameters of COST 259 channel model
# channel can be one of the following types: "typical_urban", "rural_area", "hilly_terrain"
# the channel delay profile is specified in 3GPP TR25.943 v12.0.0 Rel. 12
# This parameter is optional, and is needed only for a COST-259 channel model (default = "typical_urban")

# parameters of EXPONENTIAL channel model with Rayleigh-fade paths
# These parameters are optional, and are mandatory only for an exponential channel model
# The channel profile will consist of L+1 paths with delays multiples of dt (tap_interval), with
# The average power of each path is given by g[k] = exp(-alpha * k), with alpha the decay exponent, obtained from the
# desired rms delay
# alpha is obtained considering a delay profile with infinite paths, whose rms delay is given as
#   rms_delay = exp(-alpha/2) / (1-exp(-alpha))
# the power delay profile is truncated,such that 99,999% of the channel power is considered
#tap_interval = 1e-6
#rms_delay = 3e-6

# parameters of QUADRIGA channel mode
# QuaDRiGa channel model was developed by Fraunhofer HHI, more details in https://quadriga-channel-model.de/
