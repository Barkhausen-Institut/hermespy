########################################################################################################################
# In case of multiple antennas, the specifications for the MIMO processing are given here

# currently, only open-loop MIMO is supported
# the following schemes are supported: "SM", "SFBC", "MRC", "SC", "NONE"
# this parameter is only relevant if the number of tx and/or rx antennas > 1
# Receive diversity schemes:
# "MRC" - maximum ratio combining and
# "SC" - selection combining can be applied for 1 tx antenna and any number of rx antennas
# Transmit diversity schemes
# "SFBC" - "space-frequency block codes", following 3GPP specifications (TS 36.211, Sec, 6.3.3.3) for 2 or 4 tx antennas
# spatial Multiplexing schemes
# "SM", "SM-ZF" - spatial multiplexing with linear zero-forcing receiver
# SM-MMSE" - spatial multiplexing with linear MMSE receiver
