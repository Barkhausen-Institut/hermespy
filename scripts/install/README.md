HermesPy Windows Installer
==========================

Install the command line interface version of HermesPy by downloading and executing the current [installer](HermesPy.exe) version.
Please note that the installer is currently considered experimental and requires internet access to download its dependencies during the installation process.

After the installation process has been successfully completed, the command **hermes --help** should be exectuable from any user command line interface.


In order to build new versions of the installer, download and install [Inno Setup](https://jrsoftware.org/isdl.php) and build *hermespy.iss*.
